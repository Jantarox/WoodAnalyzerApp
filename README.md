# WoodAnalyzer

WoodAnalyzer is a GUI application for wood cross-section image browsing and analysis. The program enables users to load an image of wood, do an automatic detection of the resin ducts and the growth rings using a convolutional neural network, and make adjustments to the resulting segmentation. Next, it provides the ability to measure the area of the resin ducts per growth ring and the growth ring widths. The application presents the measurements and the segmentation to the user.

The convolutional neural network implements an algorithm developed by Anna Fabija≈Ñska and Gabriel D. Cahalan, which is fully described in their [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-34304-7).

This application has been made as a part of my thesis required to obtain an engineer's degree.
